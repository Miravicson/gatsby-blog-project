This is my first blog post. I wrote it with MDX!

There have been amazing people in my life. When I count my success, it is easy to imagine that I would say, proudly, I graduated with distinction, or perhaps mention with a smug look that I make six figures. How clich√©.
While those things are essential and have their place in a successful live. I have found that my utmost reason for believing I am a success are the amazing relationships I have with my friends and family.
